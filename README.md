## Specification

Go to [this link](http://slides.com/profdressel/julia-and-jupyter/) for slides on Julia and Jupyter.

With 1-2 partners, work through the slides.  It will have you create a new Jupyter notebook that you and your partner(s) will share.  Commit that notebook to this repository when finished.

## Assessment

It was pretty cool. It would have been cooler if there had been the Julia kernal had worked in the notebooks, hahaha.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

I can only speak for myself, but I am a mystery woman.
